</CodeGroup>

## Baml Extension

Use our [VSCode Exension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=baml.baml) for syntax highlighting, auto building `.baml` files, and inline syntax errors.

<Info>It also works with [Cursor](https://cursor.so/)!</Info>

<Warning>
  If you don't use the VSCode extension, you'll need to run: `baml build` (no
  args) every time you edit a `.baml` file.
</Warning>

### Initialize Baml in your project

```
baml init
```

This will create a baml.yaml file
