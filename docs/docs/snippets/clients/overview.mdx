Clients are used to configure how LLMs are called.

Here's an example of a client configuration:

```baml BAML
client<llm> MyClient {
  provider openai
  options {
    model gpt-4o    // Configure which model is used
    temperature 0.7 // Pass additional options to the model
  }
}
```

Usage:

```rust BAML
function MakeHaiku(topic: string) -> string {
  client MyClient
  prompt #"
    Write a haiku about {{ topic }}.
  "#
}
```

<Tip>
If you want to specify which client to use at runtime, in your Python/TS/Ruby code,
you can use the [client registry](/docs/calling-baml/client-registry) to do so.

This can come in handy if you're trying to, say, send 10% of your requests to a
different model.
