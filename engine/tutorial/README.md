BAML Implementor's Tutorial
===

This crate explains how BAML works at descending levels of abstraction.
First it illustrates how to go all the way from a set of `.baml` files and an
API key all they way to a structured response in one of the supported runtime
clients. Then, we will describe the stages of the compilation pipeline, giving
the input and output types of each stage, and showing which high-level functions
implement that stage. Finally, for each stage, we will drill down into the
finer details.

Goals
---

  1. Document the compiler for a target audience of BAML contributors.
  1. Serve as a REPL/Playground for trying new features.
  1. Call attention to parts of the compiler with leaky or hard-to-explain
     parts.

Working with this crate
---

The modules in this crate are meant to be read. Less emphasis is placed on the
actual output, although some output is generated by running it as an executable
with `cargo run`.

The crate may also be useful as a pseudo-REPL or test-harness when developing
new compiler passes, because each phase is clearly separated from the others
and supplied with appropriate input data.
